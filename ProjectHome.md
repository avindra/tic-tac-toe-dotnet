# Language port #
The language of choice was C++. It is portable and fast. I've decided to use Qt, now that is licensed under LGPL. The C++ version of this project is located here:

**Note that this project is now abandoned, and any future developments in code will go towards the C++ version**.

# About this project #

Why is this the finest example of Tic-Tac-Toe in .NET for PC around?

  * It is simple and easy to understand.
    * This is great for beginners in programming.
  * It features a mode in which you can never win against the computer. The strategy is outlined well in the source code, as well as [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy).
  * It is free and open source.
  * It is the fastest implementation I'm aware of.

# Who this is intended for #
  * Gaming buffs
  * Strategy buffs
  * Educators
  * Students

# History #
I wrote this 2 years ago when I was starting to learn programming. It was initially written it in Visual Basic .NET and has since been ported to C#. The reason why I made it in the first place is because a student of Visual Basic asked me for help with it, and I thought it would be a nice learning experience. He contributed by helping me debug and forming a few of the strategy points I missed.

The original completed Visual Basic .NET source code is available from the Downloads tab for historical purposes. It is extremely inferior to the latest revision, and one can notice the difference on a slow computer (even I feel a difference on my i7).

# Language choice #
I realize that picking C# limits this project to Windows users. Sorry, but there are a few reasons I picked C#:

  * The huge .NET framework, whose features I wanted to demonstrate.
  * Practically the same exact thing as VB.NET when compiled, except the syntax resembles the two most popular desktop application languages in today's world, C++ and Java.
  * VC++ was the initial plan, but I ran into far too many problems for such a simple project, so I stuck to C#.
